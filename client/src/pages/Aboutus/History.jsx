     <span className='font-bold'> Darbhanga College of Engineering (DCE), Darbhanga</span> is a distinguished government-owned engineering institution in Bihar, India, established in 2008 under the visionary leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Affiliated with the Bihar Engineering University (BEU), Patna, and approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the college operates under the Department of Science, Technology, and Technical Education, Government of Bihar. <br /><br /><br />

Formerly known as the Jagannath Mishra Institute of Technology (JMIT), the institution was revitalized in 2008 with its current name, Darbhanga College of Engineering, under the guidance of Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU). It became a part of Aryabhatta Knowledge University in 2011, and in 2023, following the establishment of Bihar Engineering University, it was formally affiliated with BEU, Patna. <br /><br /><br />

The college holds historical significance as it occupies the estate originally owned by Late Sri Jyoti Prasad Singh Ji, landlord of the Hariharpur Estate. Constructed in 1935, following the devastating Bihar earthquake of 1934, the building was reconstructed by M/s Bhambhri & Co., Ahmedabad, and stands as an example of earthquake-resistant architecture. This legacy blends heritage with modern engineering education, making DCE a unique institution in Bihar’s academic landscape.
